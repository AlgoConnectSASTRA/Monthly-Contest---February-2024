# Approach 
1. Declare a dictionary to store the number of victories of each team
2. Iterate through the winners list and update the dictionary
3. Sort the values of the dictionary in descending order and store it in a list
4. Now iterate through this list and find out the first position where SASTRA team's score is present
5. Return that position
